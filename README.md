# PassMeProfessor

## Summary

Pass Me Professor is a fun action game that has you grade your students papers using an ever changing rubric. A new paper will appear on your desk with a letter grade attached, its your job
to determine if based on the rubric whether that student passes or fails. Swiping right will indicate the student passes while swiping left will indicate they failed. As you grade papers correctly
more time will be added to the limit and your score will increase. Getting papers wrong will result in a decrease in time remaining. Every 5 papers graded correctly will result in the rubric changing.
